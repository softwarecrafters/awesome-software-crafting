# Awesome Software Crafting Resources

In the spirit of [awesome-software-craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship) and many other [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), this repository strives to provide well-curated material for different topics around, and beyond software crafting.

It's supposed to go beyond listing resources, but giving guidance about approaching a topic and what to expect from reading a book or listening to a talk.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to add your recommendations to this collection.

## üí° General

### üåê [List of awesome people](https://github.com/lscc/socrates-uk/wiki/List-of-awesome-people-to-recommend-to-new-devs)

A list of interesting people (not just) in tech by topic and with further links to their social media profiles or websites. Compiled at SoCraTes UK 2018.

### üåê [Awesome Software Craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship)

A curated list of resources around *Software Craftsmanship*, *Clean Code* and related programming practices. Comes with a list of [conferences](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship#school-conferences) and [communities](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship#school-communities).

## üíª Coding & Practice ‚Äç

### üìñ [Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development) by Kent Beck

In this fairly short book (240p), the reader gets a short theoretical introduction to the techniques and practices that form TDD. The reader then immediately follows Kent Beck in his journey of implementing two projects from start to finish using TDD: a money example in Java and the creation of unit testing framework in Python.

Having already attended several coderetreats, reading this book was my ([@tdpauw](https://twitter.com/tdpauw)) biggest a-ha moment in understanding how TDD works and how to apply it.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture, Design & Modelling

## üöÄ Software Development, Process & Delivery
### üìñ [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code) by Michael C. Feathers

Introduces legacy code as "code that isn't covered by tests". It explains different techniques and refactoring patterns to tackle legacy code by putting it under test. Very detailed (464 pages), but worth if you're working with legacy code a lot. The examples are in Java and C++

### üìñ [Release it!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1069827.Release_It_) by Michael T. Nygard

300 pages easy to read book explaining all the patterns to turn your application into an operatable application. This should be required reading for every software engineer.

It touches things like circuit breaker, bulkhead, zero-downtime deployments, networking in datacenters (most machines have 2 or more NIC's, make sure your app connects to the right one), gracefull startup, gracefull shutdown and many more things.

Every chapter starts with a real life disaster scenario coming from the experience Michael had working in operations.

Most of what Netflix has done in his cloud transformation and what they released now as open source tools is based on this book.

A second edition has been released in 2018.

## ü§ó Team Culture & Collaboration

## ü§î Cognitive science, Systems theory

### üìñ [Systems Thinking: A Primer by Donella H. Meadows, Diana Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)

A fairly short book (240 pages) giving a great introduction to Systems Thinking, or how to model and understand complex systems. The book always uses practical examples, such as economical or biological systems, to illustrate certain system behaviours. Contains a lot of diagrams, so maybe get the physical book and not an ebook version. See [The Donella Meadows Project](http://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-resources/) for more resources on systems thinking.
