# Awesome Software Crafting Resources

In the spirit of [awesome-software-craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship) and many other [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), this repository strives to provide well-curated material for different topics around, and beyond software crafting.

It's supposed to go beyond listing resources, but giving guidance about approaching a topic and what to expect from reading a book or listening to a talk.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to add your recommendations to this collection.

### 📖 [The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project?from_search=true) by Gene Kim,  Kevin Behr, George Spafford & [The Goal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal?ac=1&from_search=true) by Eliyahu M. Goldratt,  Jeff Cox

Two fables that introduce the reader to the general ideas of the [*Theory Of Constraints*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) through the struggle the protagonists go through as they try to save a failing manufactoring plant resp. a failing IT project. While *The Goal* sets the story in a traditional manufacturing plant, *The Phoenix Project* tells the story of a struggling IT department and how they implement DevOps practices to fix it. 

The talk **[🎥 How To Break The Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZFShSjAhlQ) by Dan North** serves as a great introduction to the principles applied in the stories of both books and the work of Eliyahu Goldratt.

## 🤗 Team Culture & Collaboration
