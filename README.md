# Awesome Software Crafting Resources

In the spirit of [awesome-software-craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship) and many other [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), this repository strives to provide well-curated material for different topics around, and beyond software crafting.

It's supposed to go beyond listing resources, but giving guidance about approaching a topic and what to expect from reading a book or listening to a talk.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to add your recommendations to this collection.

### 📖 [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code) by Michael C. Feathers

Introduces legacy code as "code that isn't covered by tests". It explains different techniques and refactoring patterns to tackle legacy code by putting it under test. Very detailed (464 pages), but worth if you're working with legacy code a lot. The examples are in Java and C++

### 📖 [The Goal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal) by Eliyahu M. Goldratt,  Jeff Cox

A novel that introduce the reader to the general ideas of the [*Theory Of Constraints*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) and the [*Five Focusing Steps*](https://www.tocinstitute.org/five-focusing-steps.html) through the struggle the protagonists go through as they try to save a failing manufactoring plant.

The talk **[🎥 How To Break The Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZFShSjAhlQ) by Dan North** serves as a great introduction to the principles applied in the stories of both books and the work of Eliyahu Goldratt.

The twitter moment [*Theory of Constraints #toc #tocot*](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1063540260179726336) introduces Theory of Constraints in 30-something tweets.

### 📖 [The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project) by Gene Kim,  Kevin Behr, George Spafford

**The Phoenix Project** is a similar novel as The Goal, but this time applied to a struggling IT department. It tells how the protagonists fix their department by implementing DevOps practices.

About *The Phoenix Project*:
> This is the IT swamp draining manual for anybody who is neck deep in alligators.

## 🤗 Team Culture & Collaboration

## 🤔 Cognitive science, Systems theory

### 📖 [Systems Thinking: A Primer by Donella H. Meadows, Diana Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)

A fairly short book (240 pages) giving a great introduction to Systems Thinking, or how to model and understand complex systems. The book always uses practical examples, such as economical or biological systems, to illustrate certain system behaviours. Contains a lot of diagrams, so maybe get the physical book and not an ebook version. See [The Donella Meadows Project](http://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-resources/) for more resources on systems thinking.
