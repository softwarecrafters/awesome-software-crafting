# Awesome Software Crafting Resources

In the spirit of [awesome-software-craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship) and many other [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), this repository strives to provide well-curated material for different topics around, and beyond software crafting.

It's supposed to go beyond listing resources, but giving guidance about approaching a topic and what to expect from reading a book or listening to a talk.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to add your recommendations to this collection.

## 💻 Coding & Practice ‍

### 📖 [Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development) by Kent Beck

In this fairly short book (240p), the reader gets a short theoretical introduction to the techniques and practices that form TDD. The reader then immediately follows Kent Beck in his journey of implementing two projects from start to finish using TDD: a money example in Java and the creation of unit testing framework in Python.

Having already attended several coderetreats, reading this book was my ([@tdpauw](https://twitter.com/tdpauw)) biggest a-ha moment in understanding how TDD works and how to apply it.

## 🏗️ Architecture, Design & Modelling

## 🚀 Software Development, Process & Delivery

### 📖 [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code) by Michael C. Feathers

Introduces legacy code as "code that isn't covered by tests". It explains different techniques and refactoring patterns to tackle legacy code by putting it under test. Very detailed (464 pages), but worth if you're working with legacy code a lot. The examples are in Java and C++

### 📖 [Release it!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1069827.Release_It_) by Michael T. Nygard

HERE BE SYNOPSIS

## 🤗 Team Culture & Collaboration

## 🤔 Cognitive science, Systems theory

### 📖 [Systems Thinking: A Primer by Donella H. Meadows, Diana Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)

A fairly short book (240 pages) giving a great introduction to Systems Thinking, or how to model and understand complex systems. The book always uses practical examples, such as economical or biological systems, to illustrate certain system behaviours. Contains a lot of diagrams, so maybe get the physical book and not an ebook version. See [The Donella Meadows Project](http://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-resources/) for more resources on systems thinking.
