# Awesome Software Crafting Resources

In the spirit of [awesome-software-craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship) and many other [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), this repository strives to provide well-curated material for different topics around, and beyond software crafting.

It's supposed to go beyond listing resources, but giving guidance about approaching a topic and what to expect from reading a book or listening to a talk.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to add your recommendations to this collection.
