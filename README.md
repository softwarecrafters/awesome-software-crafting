# Awesome Software Crafting Resources

In the spirit of [awesome-software-craftsmanship](https://github.com/benas/awesome-software-craftsmanship) and many other [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), this repository strives to provide well-curated material for different topics around, and beyond software crafting.

It's supposed to go beyond listing resources, but giving guidance about approaching a topic and what to expect from reading a book or listening to a talk.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to add your recommendations to this collection.

## 💻 Coding & Practice ‍

### 📖 [Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development) by Kent Beck

In this fairly short book (240p), the reader gets a short theoretical introduction to the techniques and practices that form TDD. The reader then immediately follows Kent Beck in his journey of implementing two projects from start to finish using TDD: a money example in Java and the creation of unit testing framework in Python.

Having already attended several coderetreats, reading this book was my ([@tdpauw](https://twitter.com/tdpauw)) biggest a-ha moment in understanding how TDD works and how to apply it.

## 🏗️ Architecture, Design & Modelling

## 🚀 Software Development, Process & Delivery

### 📖 [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code) by Michael C. Feathers

Introduces legacy code as "code that isn't covered by tests". It explains different techniques and refactoring patterns to tackle legacy code by putting it under test. Very detailed (464 pages), but worth if you're working with legacy code a lot. The examples are in Java and C++

### 📖 [Accelerate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate) by  Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim

This book is the summary of the findings of 4 years of research in the context of the [*State of DevOps Report*](https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report) (starting from 2014). It confirms lots of the beliefs we've build up over the past 2 decades in the agile community. And it also has some surprising outcomes.

From the findings, you understand how different aspects ranging from transformational leadership, technological practices that make up Continuous Delivery, lean product development and lean management all influence software delivery performance, rework, organisational culture, burn-out, job satisfaction and in the end organisational performance from a financial point of view and non-commercial performance.

The book also explains how this research has been performed and how you can apply the type of questionnairs that has been used for the research to measure how well your organisation is performing.

## 🤗 Team Culture & Collaboration

## 🤔 Cognitive science, Systems theory

### 📖 [Systems Thinking: A Primer by Donella H. Meadows, Diana Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)

A fairly short book (240 pages) giving a great introduction to Systems Thinking, or how to model and understand complex systems. The book always uses practical examples, such as economical or biological systems, to illustrate certain system behaviours. Contains a lot of diagrams, so maybe get the physical book and not an ebook version. See [The Donella Meadows Project](http://donellameadows.org/systems-thinking-resources/) for more resources on systems thinking.
